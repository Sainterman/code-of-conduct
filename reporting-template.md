# Reporting

If you feel uncomfortable, are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately either in-person, via email [medellindevops@gmail.com](mailto://medellindevops@gmail.com) or via social networks:
- Twitter [@mde_devops](https://twitter.com/mde_devops)
- Instagram [@medellindevops](https://www.instagram.com/medellindevops)

Conference staff can be identified by their STAFF t-shirts. Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe.

We recommend you use the following template to report any incident:

## Reporter
